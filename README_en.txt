Freebus Tools Software
----------------------

A program for the configuration of KNX/EIB projects.
The program is currently in development.

You can find the latest snapshots here:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ujz8cj70chswred/9WHcnQyQmV

The snapshots work for Windows 32/64 bit and Linux 32/64 bit.
A Java 7 runtime must be installed. You can either use the official Java 7
from Oracle, or the OpenJDK.

Unpack the zip and start FTS with the start script: fts.cmd or fts.sh,
depending on your system.

If you want to build FTS yourself, you need Maven or the m2eclipse plugin
for Eclipes.

FTS developers please read the file README_CODING.txt which is included
in the sources.
